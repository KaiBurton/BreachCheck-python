# BreachCheck-python

*~ RSPS Database Breach Checker ~*

**Please do not abuse or misuse this tool as this is a free tool intended for the large amount of RSPS players who have compromised passwords (~60%).**

This tool will allow you to check if a user's password/hash is compromised from a known-list of leaked RSPS databases.
The password will be hashed using SHA-1 by default and sent to an API that will compare the hash. JSON data will be returned, mentioning if the password is in a breach.

All passwords are hashed on the back-end and include around ~800K unique passwords from various RSPS database leaks (from 2009 - present)

You can implement this to your LoginDecoder (on account creation) or a ChangePassword command for example. [THROTTLE THESE REQUESTS]

Calls to the API are not logged and I would HIGHLY recommend sending hashed passwords and NOT plain-text.
API is Cloudflare Rate Limited and is set to 1000 requests a minute (PER IP). If you require more requests per minute, message me. If you are receiving error "429", please adjust your usage.

— Can use HTTP or HTTPS protocol

## Supported algorithms:
- MD5
- SHA-1
- SHA-256
- SHA-512
- PLAIN-TEXT

BCrypt is not available. Further hashing algorithms added upon request.

Return Data Example:
```
{
	"token": "39439e74fa27c09a4",
	"hash": "ed8779a2222dc578f2cffbf308411b41381a94ef25801f9dfbe04746ea0944cd",
	"hashPos": 2,
	"severity": "Top 100 Common Passwords",
	"databaseBreach": "Stoned 2021 ~800K Unique Passwords (15+ RSPS Databases)",
	"hashType": "SHA-256",
	"breached": true
}
```
— Data is sorted by most commonly used passwords, then hashed
— Returns hashPos (the line number of the password/hash)
— Returns severity (top X most common passwords)
